# CV Project

This project uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling. The main Sass file is located at `src/sass/global.scss` and is compiled to `src/styles/global.css`.

```
npm install -g sass 
```

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed.
2. To watch and compile Sass files automatically, run:

  ```
  sass src/sass/global.scss src/styles/global.css --watch
  ```

3. Edit your Sass files in `src/sass/` and the CSS will update automatically.

## Dark Mode

Dark Mode is supported and implemented with a class toggle (`.dark`) on the `<html>` element.

- Toggle button (moon / sun icon) in the navbar (`#themeToggle`).
- Preference persisted in `localStorage` under key `preferred-theme`.
- If no stored preference, system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) is applied.
- Dark overrides live in `src/sass/themes/_dark.scss` (imported explicitly in `global.scss`).

To adjust palette:
- Edit `src/sass/variables.scss` for base light + dark color scales.
- Edit `src/sass/themes/_dark.scss` for component-level overrides.

Compilation note: We removed a duplicate `dark.scss` file that caused an ambiguous import error. Make sure to re-run Sass after pulling changes.
