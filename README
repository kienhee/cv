# CV Project

This project uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling. The main Sass file is located at `src/sass/global.scss` and is compiled to `src/styles/global.css`.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed.
2. To watch and compile Sass files automatically, run:

  ```
  sass src/sass/global.scss src/styles/global.css --watch
  ```

3. Edit your Sass files in `src/sass/` and the CSS will update automatically.

## Project Structure

- `src/sass/` - Source Sass files
